Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. 
Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions,

Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds 1 screening contest.
