-- Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1. --
-- Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1. --

select func1.x, func1.y 
from functions as func1
join functions as func2 on func1.x = func2.y and func1.y = func2.x
group by func1.x, func1.y
having count(func1.x) > 1 or func1.x < func1.y
order by func1.x
